nQueens
=========

Here's a solution to the nQueen's algorithm using bit shifting and bitwise operators.

The algorithm operates on the premise that a chessboard's current state can be represented by 8 bit binary numbers. 

[i.e. given n = 4; n empty columns ==== 0000] 

Academic History
-----------
> The nQueens problem has been tackled been many academics who try to improve  time complexity of finding ways to place any number of queens (represented by n> ) on that same n x n board size.

Specifications
-----------

This nQueens solution is implemented in Javascript, to read more about Javascript bitwise operators -- refer to Mozilla's documentation on [bitwise operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators).


Installation
--------------

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bigthyme/nQueens.git
cd nQueens
```
After doing this, you can just copy and paste the contents of nQueens.js and paste it into your browser console (or node console) to run the code.
